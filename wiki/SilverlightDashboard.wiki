*The Silverlight Dashboard presents a range of graphs and *intelligent* real time electricity information that the user can configure. It is delivered by Meniscus and hosted on our servers. It is free to use with a limit of one Current Cost meter per e-mail address.*

To see an example of the dashboard then please click here http://dashboard.meniscus.co.uk/home-energy.html or there is a video if you do have Silverlight installed http://home-energy.meniscus.co.uk/flash/Home%20Energy%20Dashboard.htm

*What does the Silverlight Dashboard do?*

The Silverlight Dashboard can be run in any conventional browser. There are currently 6 different graphs that the user can select and up to 4 can be viewed at any time.
The dashboard is designed to be displayed 24/7 and we push data to the dashboard so there is actually nothing th euser has to do - the data is automatically updated.

*What information is displayed?*
  # Real Time data (every 6 seconds for the Current Cost meter) for the 3 electricity channels and the one temperature channel. This data is help for 24 hours
  # Aggregated half hour values for the 3 electricity channels and the average temperature. This data is calculated from the raw data and can be held foor several years. This forms the basis of all historical data analysis.
  # Potential to include gas and oil (and in fact any other utility)
  # Carbon equivalent for the Total electricity use and Total gas and oil if used.
  # Cost of electricity and gas and oil if used
  # Energy benchmarks

*How is this calculated?*
All the above is automatically set up when you register. We utilise a very powerful calculation engine that enables us to set up any calculation. For the Current Cost meters we have set up a "Process Template" that includes all the Data Items, costs, conversions and calulations required.


*The Dashboard will continue to develop as we improve the range of graphics available.* Features that we are developing include:
  # Automated target setting - compare actual performance against targets - Available!
  # Automated identification of cost saving opportunities - Baseline Data now available!
  # New graph to allow the user to overlay a number of similar days - Seasonal Average graph available now!
